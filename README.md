# Enhanced Mean-Variance Optimization Using Multi-Branch LSTM

This repository contains a report detailing the development and performance of an enhanced mean-variance optimization strategy utilizing a multi-branch Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for stock price prediction.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this report is to demonstrate the model's performance and the development process involved in creating an advanced portfolio optimization strategy. It provides insights into the methodology, challenges, and results achieved through the integration of machine learning techniques with traditional financial models.

## Key Highlights

*   Significant improvement in annualized returns compared to standard Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO).
*   Enhanced risk-adjusted performance, as measured by the Sharpe ratio.
*   A scalable and robust approach to portfolio management.

## Model Confidentiality

**Please note**: The source code and specific details of the model architecture are not included in this repository. Due to the model's significant profit-generating potential and scalability, it is kept confidential.

## Report Contents

The report covers the following topics:

*   Research and Model Selection
*   Multi-Branch LSTM Architecture
*   Data Preprocessing and Model Training
*   Scalability and Liquidity Considerations
*   Performance Results and Analysis
*   Future Work and Potential Improvements
